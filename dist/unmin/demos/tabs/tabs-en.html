		<p>
		From time immemorial the Norsemen <a href="#details-panel3">Example 3</a> were among the most daring and
		skilful mariners ever known. They built great wooden boats with tall,
		sweeping bows and sterns. These ships, though open and without decks,
		were yet stout and seaworthy. Their remains have been found, at times
		lying deeply buried under the sand and preserved almost intact. One
		such vessel, discovered on the shore of Denmark, measured 72 feet in
		length. Another Viking ship, which was dug up in Norway, and which is
		preserved in the museum at Christiania, was 78 feet long and 17 feet
		wide. One of the old Norse sagas, or stories, tells how King Olaf
		Tryggvesson built a ship, the keel of which, as it lay on the grass,
		was 74 ells long; in modern measure, it would be a vessel of about 942
		tons burden. Even if we make allowance for the exaggeration or
		ignorance of the writer of the saga, there is still a vast contrast
		between this vessel and the little ship Centurion in which Anson sailed
		round the world.

		It is needless, however, to prove that the Norsemen could have reached
		America in their ships. The voyages from Iceland to Greenland which we
		know they made continually for four hundred years were just as arduous
		as a further voyage from Greenland to the coast of Canada.

		<summary>Example 3</summary>
		<p>
		The story of the Norsemen runs thus. Towards the end of the ninth
		century, or nearly two hundred years before the Norman conquest, there
		was a great exodus or outswarming of the Norsemen from their original
		home in Norway. A certain King Harold had succeeded in making himself
		supreme in Norway, and great numbers of the lesser chiefs or jarls
		preferred to seek new homes across the seas rather than submit to his
		rule. So they embarked with their seafaring followers—Vikings, as we
		still call them—often, indeed, with their wives and families, in great
		open ships, and sailed away, some to the coast of England, others to
		France, and others even to the Mediterranean, where they took service
		under the Byzantine emperors. But still others, loving the cold rough
		seas of the north, struck westward across the North Sea and beyond the
		coasts of Scotland till they reached Iceland. This was in the year 874.
		Here they made a settlement that presently grew to a population of
		fifty thousand people, having flocks and herds, solid houses of stone,
		and a fine trade in fish and oil with the countries of Northern Europe.
		These settlers in Iceland attained to a high standard of civilization.
		They had many books, and were fond of tales and stories, as are all
		these northern peoples who spend long winter evenings round the
		fireside. Some of the sagas, or stories, which they told were true
		accounts of the voyages and adventures of their forefathers; others
		were fanciful stories, like our modern romances, created by the
		imagination; others, again, were a mixture of the two. Thus it is
		sometimes hard to distinguish fact and fancy in these early tales of
		the Norsemen. We have, however, means of testing the stories. Among the
		books written in Iceland there was one called the 'National Name-Book,'
		in which all the names of the people were written down, with an account
		of their forefathers and of any notable things which they had done.
